# foundry-pf2-alchemist
A small collection of macros to make playing your PF2 Alchemist on Foundry VTT a little smoother.
It needs two things to work:
1. A Journal Entry with the name "\<Your Character\>'s Formula Book". Drag Compendium links to all the items you can craft into the entry. Done.
2. A consumable item called "Infused Reagents" in your characters inventory. 
That's it, you're ready to go.
